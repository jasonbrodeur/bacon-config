Description of a first stage initialization file.
And an example of an initialization file at bottom



Setup:
	1. All traces must be enclosed in [Trace] and [End] blocks.
	2. All assignments can be on multiple lines, but should be enclosed in 
		in single quotes.  see example below.
	3. Comments must begin with a percentage sign,%.
	3. The partial path must be included with the inputFileName, when you
		locate the raw data trace in the database.
		(Using biomet_path only returns the path: 'year/site/measType/')
	4. Necessary fields are: variableName, inputFileName, measurementType,
		units, title, and minMax.
	5. All fields must be in matlab format
		All assignments must be to strings in single quotes, or numeric expressions
		(ex: threshold_const = 6,threshold_const = [6],variableName = 'Some Name')		
	6. The syntax for any other fields, such as runningFilter, are shown below:
	
The following is a description of all fields that a first stage initialization file can contain:
[Trace]
	variableName = 'The new variable name of the trace(also the ouput file name).'
	title = 'The title given to the trace variable'
	originalVariable = 'The original variable name associated with this trace.'
	inputFileName = 'The name of the raw data file in the database'
	measurementType = 'The measurement type identification: cl,fl,ch...'
	units = 'The units of the trace.'
	instrument = ''
	instrumentSN = ''		
	calibrationDates = ''
	comments = 'Some comments'
	interpolationType = 'Not Used Yet'

Automatic Plotting of multiple plots(top plot and bottom plot):
	plotTopLeft =  plots into top left axis
	plotTopRigth = plots into top right axis
	plotBottomRight = plots into bottom right axis
	plotBottomLeft =plots into bottom left axis

	%creating dependent traces:
	dependent = This field indicates that points removed/restored in the current trace 
		    should also be removed/restored in all the dependent traces listed here.	

	%The following are the cleaning parameters that can be associated with each trace:
	%
	minMax = the minimal and maximum values the trace can attain year round.(as int array)
	         Any points that lie outside minMax are replaced by NaNs
	clamped_minMax = Similar to minMax except any points exceeding these clamps are given 
			 the value of the clamp itself rather than replaced by NaNs.

	runningFilter = [filter length, standard deviations, type:standard or no phase shift]

	threshold_const = for single point despiking: this integer value will equal the maximum
			  difference between two consectutive data points.  The latter data
			  point is considered a spike if it is greater than threshold_const.
			  (Look at fr_despike)
	interpLength = Indicates the maximum length for linear interpolation.
[End]
