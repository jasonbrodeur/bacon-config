Considerations
- Build TIMESTAMP_START and TIMESTAMP_END from existing time fields (first two cols)
- Use Local Standard Time (not UTC)
- missing values = -9999
- comma-separated
- Single header row (variable names only)
- UTF-8 encoding
- Filename convention: <SITE_ID>_<RESOLUTION>_<TS-START>_<TS-END>_<OPTIONAL>.csv 
	- SITE_ID: (CA-TP1,TP2,TP3,TP4), where CA-TP4 is TP39
	- RESOLUTION: HH
	- TS-START: YYYYMMDDHHMM
	- TS-END: YYYYMMDDHHMM
	- example: CA-TP4_HH_200301010000_201712312400

Gap-filled data must be identified using the _F variable qualifier

For gas and heat storage fluxes, a positive value indicates net increase of matter or energy storage within the ecosystem.

_H_V_R (Three-index positional qualifier)
Horizontal position (H): Use of the same H index indicates the same position within the horizontal plane among variables with the same base name. For example, observations that have the same variable base name and are arranged in a vertical profile would have the same H index. Note: variables with different base names could have different H indices even if located in the same physical location.

Vertical position (V): Use of the same V index indicates the same position along the vertical axis among variables with the same base name. Indices must be in order, starting with the highest. For example, V = 1 for the highest air temperature or most shallow soil temperature sensor in a profile. The indices are assigned on the basis of the relative position for each vertical profile separately.

Replicate (R): The R index indicates that the variable is measured in the same position (both H and V) as another sensor. Two co-located sensors are considered “replicates” if the difference in observations is due to separate instrumentation or different measurement technique. Spatial variability is never represented with different R indices. Defining spatial variability versus replication is variable dependent. For example, two radiometers measuring incoming radiation that are spaced 1 meter apart horizontally could be considered replicates, while two soil water content sensors at 1 meter horizontally spacing may have different spatial positions (different H indices).

%%Conversions required:
- Convert SnowDepth_BlwCnpy from m to cm (x100) [done]
- Convert NaNs to -9999 [done]
- export as local time (not UTC) [done]

%%Calculations required:
- TIMESTAMP_END and TIMESTAMP_START [done]
- Calculate VPD in the mcm_metfill process and export it into each master file [Should be done -- just need to rerun all]

%% Sapflow actions:
- need to output sapflow in units of mmolH2O m-2 s-1 (new variable should be named F_mmol_final#) [done]
- Add in dT_finalxx variables to master file. [Should be done -- just need to recompile (I think)]
- Recompile all master files

%% Questions: 
- We are exporting GEONOR for each site--should we do this, or just export a separate file for the PPT station?

To do:
- Rerun mcm_sapflow_calc for all years (TP39+TP74) [worked!]
- recompile sapflow master files from scratch [worked!]
- rerun mcm_metfill for all years
- recompile all master files (do it from scratch?)
- finalize flux calculation configurations with Zoran
- rerun all flux calculations
- recompile all master files
- export to Ameriflux format [Working.]
- develop metadata

%%% Record of updates:
- Identified that there are versioning issues between config files and scripts on our data PC and the field PCs. 
-- Jay and Zoran need to meet and discuss this.
- reconfigured master lists and redeveloped scripts so to export in Ameriflux format. 
-- requred development of new set of scripts to enable their format. 
-- resulted in additional variables being included in the exported variables (including H20 concentration, filled met variables, VPD)
-- configured sapflow files so that they can be uploaded to Ameriflux (previously not exported in any format)--required reconfiguration of calculation scripts
- reran all met data filling to generate VPD
- recompiled all master files from scratch
%%% Need to do:
- finalize flux calculation configurations with Zoran
- rerun all flux calculations
- recompile all master files
- export to Ameriflux format [Working. Needs check.]
- check data
- develop metadata
